# Sudoku-Solver

## Introduction

Two things I am passionate about today are computer science and sudoku, so it made sense to me
to combine these two and tackle an interesting project. I have always enjoyed leveraging the power
of computers as a means of solving problems, and solving a sudoku puzzle is no exception. It also
gives me the opportunity to puts the different skills I've learned into practice, from algorithm design
to clean code principals. I hope for this project to evolve like the knowledge I've gained in CS also.

## Instructions for use

## What I have accomplished so far

* I created a basic GUI using tkinter from python. I went for a clean, minimal design that is (hopefully)
simple and easy to use
* The solver so far can solve easy puzzles that use basic elimination techniques in it's algorithms.
* The solver uses custom .sudoku files that are easy to create for personal testing. Each row represents a
row on the sudoku grid and has nine values for each column. A blank space is represented by a zero.

## What is to come

* In order to solve every puzzle (that has a possible solution), I want to create algorithms for the more
advanced techniques (such as swordfish and X-wing)
* A brute force algorithm is possible for solving a sudoku puzzle using a computer, so I want to create 
a backtracking branching algorithm that can find a solution. This would be helpful for a puzzle that cannot
be solved using common techniques
